# CSS

## 1. CSS Concepts

### Selectors

- The parts of a CSS rule
- Simple selectors
- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Complex selectors.
  - Combinator selectors.
  - Compound selectors

### The cascade

- Position and order of appearance
- Specificity
- Origin
- Importance

### Specificity

- Specificity scoring. Scoring each selector type
- Specificity in context. Calculation
- Pragmatically increasing specificity

### Inheritance

- Inheritance flow
- Inheritable properties (color, font, text...)
- inheritance works: explicitly inherit and control inheritance
  - keywords: `inherit`, `initial`, `unset`

## 2. CSS Language and functionality

### Pseudo-elements

- `::before` and `::after`

### RWD

- Media Queries
- Container queries
  > new

### Accesibility

- `prefers-reduced-motion`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested that the system minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses.
- `prefers-reduced-data`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested the web content that consumes less internet traffic.
- `prefers-color-scheme`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested a light or dark color theme.
- `color-scheme`
  > new _CSS property_ that allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.
- `color-contrast()`
  > new _functional notation_ that takes a color value and compares it to a list of other color values, selecting the one with the highest contrast from the list.

#### HTML Accesibility

- **tabindex** (HTML)
  - global _HTML attribute_ that indicates that its element can be focused, and where it participates in sequential keyboard navigation (usually with the Tab key, hence the name).
- **ARIA HTML**
  - set of _HTML attributes_ that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

### Performance

- Feature support queries or feature query (`@supports`)
  > new _CSS at-rule_ for specify declarations that depend on a browser's support for one or more specific CSS features.
  > The rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside any other conditional group at-rule.
- `content-visibility`
  > new _CSS property_ that enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work, including layout and painting, until it is needed. Enhance performance
- `containment`
  > new _CSS property_ that allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree.
  > This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.
- `will-change`
  > new _CSS property_ that hints to browsers how an element is expected to change. Browsers may set up optimizations before an element is actually changed. These kinds of optimizations can increase the responsiveness of a page by doing potentially expensive work before they are actually required.
