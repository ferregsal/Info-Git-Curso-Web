# CSS

## 1. CSS Concepts

### Selectors

- The parts of a CSS rule
- Simple selectors
- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Complex selectors.
  - Combinator selectors.
  - Compound selectors

### The cascade

- Position and order of appearance
- Specificity
- Origin
- Importance

### Specificity

- Specificity scoring. Scoring each selector type
- Specificity in context. Calculation
- Pragmatically increasing specificity

### Inheritance

- Inheritance flow
- Inheritable properties (color, font, text...)
- inheritance works: explicitly inherit and control inheritance
  - keywords: `inherit`, `initial`, `unset`

## 2. CSS Language and functionality

### Pseudo-elements

- `::before` and `::after`
- `::first-letter`
- `::first-line`
- `::backdrop` (for `dialog` or `video`)

- `::selection`
- `::placeholder`
- `::cue` (for `video`)

### Pseudo-classes

- Interactive states
  - `:hover`
  - `:active`

  - `:target`
- Historic states
  - `:link`
  - `:visited`
- Form states
  - `:disabled` and `:enabled` (for buttons)

  > new _CSS module_ that allows for the creation of custom properties that can be used over and over.
  - access to custom properties: `var()`
- Mathematical expressions:
  > new _CSS functions_ for calculation and mathematical comparison
  - `calc(a,b)`

- Other Color functions: `hwb()`, `lab()` and `lch()`
- Where to use color in CSS rules

#### Color Tools

- `accent-color`
  > new _CSS property_ that sets the accent color for user-interface controls generated by some elements.
- `color-gamut`

### Box Model

- Content and sizing. Extrinsic sizing v. intrinsic sizing
  - `min-content`
  - `max-content`
    > _sizing keyword_ for intrinsic sizing that represents the intrinsic minimum or maximum width of the content.

### Flexbox (Display flex)

> New _module of CSS_ that defines a CSS box model optimized for user interface design, and the layout of items in one dimension.

  > font-variant-numeric CSS property controls the usage of alternate glyphs for numbers, fractions, and ordinal markers.
- Variable fonts (different variants of a typeface in one file)
  > new evolution of the OpenType _font specification_ that enables many different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file, rather than having a separate font file for every width, weight, or style.

### RWD

- Media Queries
- Container queries
  > new

### Accesibility

- `prefers-reduced-motion`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested that the system minimize the amount of non-essential motion it uses.
- `prefers-reduced-data`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested the web content that consumes less internet traffic.
- `prefers-color-scheme`
  > new _media feature_ that is used to detect if the user has requested a light or dark color theme.
- `color-scheme`
  > new _CSS property_ that allows an element to indicate which color schemes it can comfortably be rendered in.
- `color-contrast()`
  > new _functional notation_ that takes a color value and compares it to a list of other color values, selecting the one with the highest contrast from the list.

#### HTML Accesibility

- **tabindex** (HTML)
  - global _HTML attribute_ that indicates that its element can be focused, and where it participates in sequential keyboard navigation (usually with the Tab key, hence the name).
- **ARIA HTML**
  - set of _HTML attributes_ that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.

### Performance

- Feature support queries or feature query (`@supports`)
  > new _CSS at-rule_ for specify declarations that depend on a browser's support for one or more specific CSS features.
  > The rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside any other conditional group at-rule.
- `content-visibility`
  > new _CSS property_ that enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering work, including layout and painting, until it is needed. Enhance performance
- `containment`
  > new _CSS property_ that allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree.
  > This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.
- `will-change`
  > new _CSS property_ that hints to browsers how an element is expected to change. Browsers may set up optimizations before an element is actually changed. These kinds of optimizations can increase the responsiveness of a page by doing potentially expensive work before they are actually required.

# Conclusions
